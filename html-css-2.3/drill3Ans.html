    Note: These are first impressions and based on conjecture since we don’t
    know the exact details. Aurora will be the second Duelist Defender to appear
    in the game, the first being 6★ Eunectes. This Archetype is characterize by
    high stats, block-1, high DP costs, and only gaining SP when they are
    blocking. Only gaining SP while blocking can be very limiting and annoying
    to work around when you want to have the high-impact skills available at the
    time you need them.

    Aurora's Talent seems like it is an attempt to address this problem: she
    won't attack at all if her SP is less than half and will regen HP instead,
    allowing weaker enemies to survive while they charge her skills. This could
    have some potential drawbacks, however, as if you are hoping to have Aurora
    hold a lane, her block-1 means she will easily get overrun if she isn't
    killing what she is blocking. Since the self-regen is only occurring until
    half of max SP, it isn't clear if it will be enough to be relied upon to
    enable Aurora to function solo without healing support. S1 looks to be a
    defensive oriented skill, increasing block count and DEF and granting Status
    Resistance. Although Status Resistance can be a situationally useful tool,
    purely defensive skills aren't overly useful in the current game, and her
    lower block count, even with skill active, would make her generally less
    useful for this role than Normal Defenders.
